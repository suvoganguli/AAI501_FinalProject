# AAI501 FinalProject

**Problem Statement:**

  The use of smartphone data to predict human activity has been often studied in machine learning and data science. This involves collecting data from smartphone sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope and then training a classifier to classify and predict the activity of the user. These sensors can be used to detect movements like walking, running, or sitting, and even track more complex activities like climbing stairs. Once the classifier is trained, it can be used for predicting human movements based on new test data.
  In order to do this, we need to collect the sensor data with the user doing different activities. Then, we will clean up and organize the data so that we can use it in machine learning algorithms. We will use statistical analysis and data visualization to understand the data trends and patterns. We may want to do a correlation analysis to reduce the number of features to be used for training the classifier.
  Once we get the data ready, we will train a classifier to predict the human activity. We will choose a set of classifiers and compare their performances. Finally, we will choose the classifier which has the best performance for predicting the training/test data. 
  For this project, we have chosen the UC Irvine dataset “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones” (UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, 2012). The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then averaged using moving average filters. Furthermore, low and high frequency cutoff filters were used to preprocess the data.
  The following is an overview of the tasks involved in this:
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model selection
- Training 
- Evaluation
